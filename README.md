## Week 1: Tutorial on OpenAI Gymnasium
- Tutorial on Getting Started With OpenAI Gym: The Basic Building Blocks.
- Implementation of the CartPole-v0 environment and writing a program to:
  - Implement the CartPole environment for a certain number of steps.
  - Implement the CartPole environment for a certain number of episodes.
  - Compare and comment on the rewards earned for both approaches.
  - Plot the cumulative reward of the games and note down the results.

## Week 2: Problem Solving Agents & Search, Policy
### Question 1: The Game
